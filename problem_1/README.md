# Problem 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5 we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.If

Find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below __N__.Find

## Input
First line __T__ contains the number of test cases. __T__ lines follow, each line containing an integer __N__.First

## Constraints
1 <= T <= 10^5
1 <= N <= 10^9

## Output
For each test case, print the sum of the multiples.
